              Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, London, as
              the first child of the Duke & Duchess of York (later King George
              VI and Queen Elizabeth). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936
              upon the abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII, making
              Elizabeth the heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home
              and began to undertake public duties during the Second World War,
              serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service.

              In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince
              of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until
              his death in April 2021. They had four children: Charles III;
              Anne, Princess Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince
              Edward, Earl of Wessex. Elizabeth II was Queen of the United
              Kingdom from 6 February 1952 until her death in 2022. Her reign of
              70 years and 214 days was the longest of any British monarch and
              the second-longest recorded of any monarch of a sovereign country.
              At the time of her death, Elizabeth was also Queen of 14 other
              Commonwealth realms in addition to the United Kingdom.
