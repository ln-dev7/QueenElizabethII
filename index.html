              Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, London, as the
              first child of the Duke & Duchess of York (later King George VI and
              Queen Elizabeth). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the
              abdication of his brother, King Edward VIII, making Elizabeth the heir
              presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to undertake
              public duties during the Second World War, serving in the Auxiliary
              Territorial Service.

              In November 1947, she married Philip Mountbatten, a former prince of
              Greece and Denmark, and their marriage lasted 73 years until his death
              in April 2021. They had four children: Charles III; Anne, Princess
              Royal; Prince Andrew, Duke of York; and Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex.
              Elizabeth II was Queen of the United Kingdom from 6 February 1952
              until her death in 2022. Her reign of 70 years and 214 days was the
              longest of any British monarch and the second-longest recorded of any
              monarch of a sovereign country. At the time of her death, Elizabeth
              was also Queen of 14 other Commonwealth realms in addition to the
              United Kingdom.
